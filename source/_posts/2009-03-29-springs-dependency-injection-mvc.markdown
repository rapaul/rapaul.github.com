Below are slides from a presentation I gave to colleagues at Kiwiplan. The presentation covered two [Spring Framework](http://www.springsource.org/) topics, the first being a brief introduction to Spring's Dependency Injection Container.  The second presentation was an introduction to Spring's MVC (web) component, with a focus on the annotation style introduced in Spring 2.5.  PDF versions are available for both [Dependency Injection](http://www.rapaul.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/spring_dependency_injection.pdf) and [MVC](http://www.rapaul.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/spring_mvc.pdf).
