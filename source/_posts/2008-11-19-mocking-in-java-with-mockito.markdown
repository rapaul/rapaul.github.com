A ran a session at the [Auckland Java User Group](http://www.meetup.com/auckland-jug/calendar/9081887/) on using [Mockito](http://mockito.org/).  Slides are embedded below using slideshare:


[Mocking in Java with Mockito](http://www.slideshare.net/rapaul/mockito-presentation?type=powerpoint)


View SlideShare [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/rapaul/mockito-presentation?type=powerpoint) or [Upload](http://www.slideshare.net/upload?type=powerpoint) your own.





As promised I've attached my [slides](http://www.rapaul.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mockito.pdf) and also included the example source files in a [zip](http://www.rapaul.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mockito-example-code.zip).  To run the unit tests you will need [JUnit 4.5](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15278&package_id=12472) and [Mockito 1.6](http://mockito.googlecode.com/files/mockito-all-1.6.jar).
