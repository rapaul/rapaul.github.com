Corey Haines was in town last month and delivered a great talk at [Codemania](http://codemania.co.nz/). Fortunately for us he stuck around for the weekend and facilitated Auckland's first (as far as I know) [Coderetreat](http://coderetreat.org/).

## Global Day of Coderetreat, 8th December 2012
On Saturday the 8th of December, developers from all over the globe will be taking part in the [Global Day of Coderetreat](http://globalday.coderetreat.org/). The last Auckland Coderetreat filled up quick, this December we are fortunate enough to have 2 Coderetreats in Auckland.

* Hosted at Movio ([sign up](http://www.meetup.com/kiwi-code-retreat/events/91578512/))
* Hosted at BizDojo ([sign up](http://www.meetup.com/kiwi-code-retreat/events/89757822/))

Each of these Coderetreats are language agnostic, so take your pick. I'll be facilitating the Movio Coderetreat, so that may sway your choice either way :P

Alex Henderson is facilitating the BizDojo Coderetreat and has written about it over on his [blog](http://blog.bittercoder.com/2012/11/04/global-day-of-code-retreat-2012/).

Thanks to the great sponsors of these events there is no cost! To top that off there will be delicious food and drink provided throughout the day. 

Wellington peeps, [you're in luck too](http://www.meetup.com/kiwi-code-retreat/events/90182862/).

### What to bring
* A laptop with a development environment setup (1 or more languages)
* A way to run tests
* A collaborative mindset, all work is done in pairs
* An open mind

## Coderewhat?
If you haven't heard of a Coderetreat before here's a quick summary pulled from [coderetreat.org/about](http://coderetreat.org/about).

> Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.

Sound exhausting? It is. It's also a great deal of fun!

If this sounds like you, please [sign up](http://www.meetup.com/kiwi-code-retreat/) and we'll see you on the 8th!
