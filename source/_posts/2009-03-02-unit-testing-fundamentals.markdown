Below and [attached](http://www.rapaul.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/unit_testing_fundamentals.pdf) are slides from a presentation I gave to colleagues at Kiwiplan.  The presentation covers a range of topics regarding unit testing best practices, including test driven development (TDD), mocking frameworks, avoiding over-specification and test coverage.  The slides also include diagrams to help explain the concept of isolating code through the use of seams.

I've attached the final outcome of the live TDD examples.  Obviously TDD doesn't come across very well as a final solution, however the code also provides basic examples of the [Mockito](http://www.mockito.org) and [Rhino Mocks](http://ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx) libraries.  The code style is based on Spring Framework's annotation driven MVC framework.

[Java example code](http://www.rapaul.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/java-unit-testing-example.zip) - JUnit, Mockito, EclEMMA (Eclipse Java coverage)
