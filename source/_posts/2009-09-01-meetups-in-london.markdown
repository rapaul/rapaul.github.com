One of the great things about London, from a developer's perspective, is the wealth of meetups going on.  Don't get me wrong, in Auckland we had a few notable meetups including the [Auckland JVM Group](http://www.meetup.com/auckland-jug/) and the [Auckland Web Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/aucklandweb/). But London has more people, more developers & hence more meetups.

Below is a live calendar of the meetups I'm planning on attending, 



I'll try to keep this up to date, so feel free to subscribe to the calendar if you have similar interests (java, javascript, groovy, scala, testing, mocking, android, webOS, html5... anything you see in this blog's tag cloud).
